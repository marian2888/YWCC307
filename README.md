My presentation is on Artificial intelligence in the world. 
Artifilligence Intelligence intelligence is the development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks 
that would usually require a human to do. It is used in our everyday lives whether we realize it or not. 
It can be seen in our phones, travel navigation, smartcars, drones, smart home devices, etc. 

This presentation talks about AI in our every day lives, how it appears in some of the top industries, how it works, and how it is affecting human interaction. Additionally, it discusses some of the negative effects AI is causing.
